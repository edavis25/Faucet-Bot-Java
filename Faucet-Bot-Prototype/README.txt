FAUCET BOT PROTOTYPE  -  README.txt
-------------------------------------

Simple prototype for a bot that claims a reward from a Bitcoin faucet. Personal information such as wallet addresses,
login information, etc... have been removed and must be added to run.

This uses Selenium to launch a Google Chrome Web Driver that follows commands that mimic an actual user
using the web browser.

The Google Chrome Driver .exe file has been included in the folder for convenience.

The jar files for Selenium external libraries, etc... can be found in the lib folder.
